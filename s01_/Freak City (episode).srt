00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,000
be kind without expecting
anything in return.

336
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,561
I should've given
you that sugar

337
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,039
cube without even thinking
about a reward.

338
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,405
Wrong!

339
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,306
Whoa! Whoa!

340
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,867
- Ah, geez!
- Finn!

341
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,970
You've gifted us nothing
but heartache, Magic Man!

342
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,309
What's the life lesson in that?!

343
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,815
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]

344
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:22,047
Yes, my children,
you are so close to the answer.

345
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,089
Answer <i>this!</i>

346
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,748
Get his eyes!

347
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,917
Cut him in the eyes!

348
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,191
I wish I'd never been nice to you
'cause you're just a big jerk!

349
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,958
Oh, yes, that's it!

350
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,830
You've finally
learned your lesson.

351
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:41,032
And now I'm off to spread my
teachings to more sissy do-gooders.

352
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,472
You're welcome!

353
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,600
Man, I frickin' hate that guy.

354
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,703
But at least now we can all
go back to our regular lives.

355
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,838
Well, actually...

356
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,313
We like being like this.

357
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,975
Yeah, we're strong together.

358
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,211
ALL:
Bye, Finn! Thank you!

359
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,048
Oh, okay. Bye, guys.

360
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,951
See you later.

361
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,513
Wait, so, what was the
lesson we just learned?

362
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,492
Maybe it was,
don't give your sugar to jerks.

363
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,393
Speaking of jerks,
what the blubins, man?!

364
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,330
Why wouldn't you help
me turn back into a boy?!

365
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,767
Well, because I kind of
always wanted [MUMBLES]

366
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,666
What?

367
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:15,070
I said, "I kind of always
wanted to be a foot myself."

368
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,234
You could be a
foot right now.

369
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,641
I saw you change into
a foot twice yesterday.

370
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,270
It's complicated, man.

371
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,975
You'll understand
when you're older.
