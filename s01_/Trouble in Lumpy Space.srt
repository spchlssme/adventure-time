[ECHOING] Finn?

00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,876
Hey, Finn. Hey, buddy.

322
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,109
- Finn!
- Huh?

00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,775
[NORMAL VOICE]
Hey, dude. We made it.

324
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,582
Man, there's something
cold under my butt.

325
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,815
Oh!
[LAUGHS]

00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,880
The antidote.
Just in time, too.

327
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,256
LSP, I'm sorry I blew up
at you before.

328
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,385
I didn't mean it.

329
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,122
I was just really stressed out.

330
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,493
You know, it's fine.

331
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,088
You and Jake can
make it up to me

332
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,157
by dancing this
last dance with me.

333
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,499
Sounds good to me.
What do you say, Jake?

334
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,401
[LUMPY VOICE]
That sounds totally lame.
